# Table Names
The names should follow some patterns:
    - Lowercase
    - Plural
    - Use "_" instead of blank spaces

    Ex:
    - patrons
    - books
    - new_employees

Table rows and collumns are referred to as records and fields

# Records
A record id a row that holds data on an individual observation

card_num | name | member_year | total_fine
  45783  |Jasmin|    2022     |    2.05   <- Jasmin became a member in 2022 and owes $2.05

# Fields  
A field is a column that holds one piece of information about all records
    - The "name" field lists all of the names of the Table

    Field names should:
        - Be lowercase
        - Have no spaces
        - Be singular
        - Be different from other field names
        - Be different from the table name

# Keys (Unique identifiers)
Are used to identify records in a table, they are unique and often numbers
